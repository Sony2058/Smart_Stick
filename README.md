# SmartStick Project
A smart walking stick that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and alert the user via a buzzer. The project utilizes an Arduino UNO, ultrasonic sensor, and buzzer to provide real-time feedback, enhancing the userâ€™s awareness of their surroundings.

## Components:
- Arduino UNO
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Buzzer
- Battery and Case
- Jumper Wires

## How It Works:
- The ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles in front of the user.
- If an obstacle is detected within a distance of 30 cm, the buzzer will sound to alert the user.

## Installation:
1. Upload the Arduino code to the Arduino UNO.
2. Connect the ultrasonic sensor and buzzer.
3. Power on the system and start using the SmartStick.
